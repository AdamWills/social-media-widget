# Accessible Social Media Widget

After searching for a social media widget (similar to AddThis) that meets accessibility requirements and having no luck, I figured it was time to create one.  While I just creating something small scale to fit the needs of a project, hopefully this can grow into something bigger and better.  Have to start somewhere, though!
